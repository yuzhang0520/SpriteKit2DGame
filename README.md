• Have every 5th dropped object be an object (different image sprite) the player must collide with for points.
• Scoring: 10 points for colliding with the dropped object and 1 point per second the player is alive.
• Timing: have the level end after 60 seconds.
• Save the high score in Userdefaults.

• Have labels indicating the title of the game, score, time left and high score.
